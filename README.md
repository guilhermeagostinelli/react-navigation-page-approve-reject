# React Record Navigation / Approval Page

Implementation of a record navigation page with approve / reject buttons using React. Each action - approving or rejecting - triggers a confirmation dialog before performing the desired operation.

This project also consists of a boilerplate code, containing:
- API communication code using axios
- Spinning loader (implemented as a High Order Component) that appears while the data is being fetched from the API
- Components styled with Material Design
- Routing system

## Prerequisites

Just make sure you have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) installed.
